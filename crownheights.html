        <p>The area that is now referred to as Crown Heights is the ancestral land of the Lenape people. "Brooklyn" was specifically inahbited by the Canarsee and Marechkawieck tribes before they were killed or driven out of the land by European settlers in the late 1600's. After the arrival of the Dutch, the land was sparsely used until Weeksville formed in the 1830’s. Weeksville was a free black community named for one of the original land owners: James Weeks. While Weeksville prospered in the North, the Southern part of the neighborhood carried a poor reputation as it housed the Kings County Penitentiary. The prison was also referred to as Crow Hill Penitentiary, a name that has disputed origins, but likely stems from a racist term used for the African-American population that lived in the area. The prison was torn down in 1906, marking the start of a period of gentrification. New homes were built, and wealthier residents flooded to the neighborhood. Property developers sought to change the name “Crow Hill” and erase the neighborhood’s affiliation with African-American convicts. It’s unclear exactly when and how the name “Crown Heights” came to be, but many believe the name is in reference to the staple Crown Street, and the neighborhood’s hilly terrain. </p>
