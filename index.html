            Statues receive a considerable amount of attention as monuments to figures past. The question of what it truly means to memorialize historical figures, particularly those who were colonizers, slave-owners, or confederate leaders, has sparked a significant cultural dialogue. Beyond the grandeur of statues, the very names that punctuate our daily lives—the streets we traverse, the parks we visit, the gardens we enjoy — are also named for individuals of the near and distant past. Although these names take up significant space in our everyday vocabulary and sense of place, the history of the people for which they are named often remain unknown to the current day residents (myself included). I took the opportunity to investigate the names of places in my own neighborhood, Crown Heights. And in doing so, become more familiar with the history of my neighborhood and the people who have had a hand in shaping it, for better or for worse.
